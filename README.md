EWS Android API
===============

A java client library to access Exchange web services, packaged for Android. The API works against Office 365 Exchange Online as well as on premises Exchange.
For API details, guidelines and examples go to [ews-java-api][ews-java-url].

Building
--------

Check-out the ews-java-api submodule:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

The following command creates a fat jar under ews-android-api/build/libs called **ews-android-api.jar**.

```
./gradlew copySources ews-android-api:build
```

Download
--------
Not available at this stage.  
  
Currently you have to manually build the project, copy the ews-android-api.jar to your module's libs folder and then add those dependencies to your build.gradle script:
```groovy
implementation files('libs/ews-android-api.jar')
implementation 'joda-time:joda-time:2.8'
implementation 'dnsjava:dnsjava:2.1.6'
```

Proguard rules (add them to your app):
```
# required in LogFactory#getLog
-keep class android.org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory { *; }
-keep class android.org.apache.commons.logging.impl.LogFactoryImpl { *; }

# required in LogFactoryImpl#discoverLogImplementation / LogFactoryImpl#createLogFromClass
-keep class android.org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger { *; }

# required by EwsServiceXmlWriter
-keep class com.sun.xml.stream.ZephyrWriterFactory { *; }
# the below classes might be required as well
-keep class com.sun.xml.stream.ZephyrParserFactory { *; }
-keep class com.sun.xml.stream.events.ZephyrEventFactory { *; }
```



Usage (example)
---------------

```java
ExchangeService service = new ExchangeService(ExchangeVersion.Exchange2010_SP2);
ExchangeCredentials credentials = new WebCredentials("emailAddress", "password");
service.setCredentials(credentials);
service.setUrl(new URI("http://some-ews-server.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx"));

EmailMessage message = new EmailMessage(service);
message.getToRecipients().add("administrator@some-ews-server.com");
message.setSubject("Hello world!");
message.setBody(MessageBody.getMessageBodyFromText("Sent using the EWS Android API."));
message.send();
```
